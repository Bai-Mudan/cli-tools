## About Bai Mudan

**Bai Mudan** is the GitHub organization under which this project is developed.  
The name comes from the *White Peony* (白牡丹) tea — symbolizing simplicity, clarity, and quiet strength.  
Just like a tea ceremony built around Bai Mudan, we believe that creating and using CLI tools can be a small, meaningful ritual:  
focused, mindful, and quietly powerful.  
We aim to build clean, practical, and lightweight scripts that make everyday development smoother and more intentional.
